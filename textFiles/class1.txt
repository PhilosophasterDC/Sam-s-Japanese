	You sit in your seat waiting anxiously as the first day of class begins.  Looking around, you don't see anyone you know, not that you were expecting to.  Despite being early in the morning, you made sure to get here early.  This was not going to be some cliché show where you are late the first day of class and get a reputation as the trouble maker.

	
	After a few more minutes, the professor walks in and quickly sets up.  With a big smile on her face, she address the class:

		"Ohayoo gozaimasu! Watashi no namae wa Tokeshi sensei desu."
		(ohio go-zah-ee-mah-s! wah-tah-she no nah-mah-A wah toe-kay-she say-n-say-ee des.)
	With a quick laugh to herself at the look on everyone's faces, she continues:
		"Don't worry if you did not understand anything I just said, you weren't supposed to...
		 yet.  I told you all 'Good morning! My name is professor Tokeshi.'  In this class, you
		 will learn how to say phrases such as this and much more.  Sadly, we will not be covering
		 how to read or write Japanese, just how to speak it.  To start off, we'll go over pronunciations."
	Professor Tokeshi writes a list of a as follows:

			Japanese			English
			a				ah (as in bop)
			i				ee (as in beep)
			u				oo (as in boom)
			e				ai (as in bait)
			o				oh (as in bone)

							elongate the sound
							(aa -> ahhhh
			double vowel			 ii -> eeeee
							 uu -> ooooo
							 ee -> aiiii
							 oo -> ohhhh)

	The rest of the class consists of going over these pronunciations and practicing them over and over and over...... and over again.  As noon approaches, Professor Tokeshi asks
		"Does everyone think they get the concept of today's lesson?"

1)	Yes
2)	Not quite...
