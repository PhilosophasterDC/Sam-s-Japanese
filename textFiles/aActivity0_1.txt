	You grab the notebook and chase after Alyssa calling out to her.  She stops halfway out of the exit, looking as if she was seriously considering just running for it.
		"You forgot this in the room."
	She looks at her feet, as she quietly thanks you and sticks the notebook in her bag.  The two of you stand there in silence for a count of ten:  you because you're waiting to see if she'll say anything more, and her because she doesn't quite know what to do in this situation.  You finally break the silence:
		"I'm Sam by the way."
	Just barely above a whisper, she replies:
		"My name is Alyssa..."
	It's clear that she does not have a lot of experience talking to other people, and you don't want to make her any more uncomfortable than you already have, so you tell her bye and head off.
