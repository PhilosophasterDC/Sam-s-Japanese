pressing the "enter" button or the "return" button.  The actual game has no need
to type words, just type the corresponding number for the list of possible actions.

You will be playing as Sam, a university student taking a special class to study the
Japanese language.  Unfortunately, your class is seven days a week for one hundred days.
Every odd day will be a lesson, and every even day will be a review.  There will be a quiz
every ten days.  After the one hundred days, there will be a final test.

In the afternoon, you will be able to get to know your classmates, and in the evening you will
get to choose between studying or working to make money.  Learn as much as you can, and try to
make some friends along the way.

If you understand these instructions, please type "go" and enjoy the game :)
