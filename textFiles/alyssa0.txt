	You walk up to Alyssa, but she seems to ignore your approach.  As you reach her desk, she shifts her head to allow her hair to cover her face from you.  She obviously is not very social.  Wordlessly packing up her things, she slings her bag over her shoulder and rushes out of the room.  As she turns the corner, you notice that she forgot her notebook.
1)	Chase after her and return the notebook.
2)	Leave it, she was rude to you by not saying 'hi.'
