	You enter the class feeling confident about the lesson ahead.  Today you are only reviewing yesterday's lesson, so it should be fairly easy.  Professor Tokeshi walks into the room:
		"Ohayoo gozaimasu! Hajimemashoo!  That means 'let us begin'."
	She rewrites the chart from yesterday and goes over it with the class a few times before asking everyone to work with the person next to them, pronouncing the letters on the board

			Japanese			English
			a				ah (as in bop)
			i				ee (as in beep)
			u				oo (as in boom)
			e				ai (as in bait)
			o				oh (as in bone)

							elongate the sound
							(aa -> ahhhh
			double vowel			 ii -> eeeee
							 uu -> ooooo
							 ee -> aiiii
							 oo -> ohhhh)

	After saying the vowels back and forth a few times, Professor Tokeshi stops everyone:
		"Jouzukata! Well done everyone. That will be all for today.  Tomorrow we will go over different greetings and other similar phrases.  Please study hard for class. Owarimashoo! Let us end."
