	After class, you see two students stay behind a little longer than the rest as they pack their bags.  One is a thin girl with rectangular glasses covering a face of freckles and holding back her shoulder length, brown hair.  It looks as if she doesn't spend much time outside and kind of reminds you of a small mouse.  She introduced herself as Alyssa to the class, but you only heard because she sits two seats in front of you.
	On the other side of the room is a taller boy.  You think he might have said his name is John, but you're not entirely sure.  He's wearing a blue and white T-shirt for some sports team, and has a wide build.  His darker skin tone and permanently wind-swept hair implies that he's often basking in the sun.
